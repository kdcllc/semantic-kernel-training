## What is Semantic Kernel?

Semantic Kernel is an innovative technology that allows you to supercharge your problem-solving creativity. It’s like having your own “Easy Bake Oven” for artificial intelligence! With Semantic Kernel, you can run AI prompts right on your local machine, harnessing the power of LLM (Large Language Models) to enhance your projects.

## Usage

This code utilizes Azure Key Vault to store secure values. It is possible to replace it with secrets.

```bash

    dotnet run -- -t basic

```
